<!-- 
    css is divided into three parts
    selector { 
        property: value;
    }

    selectors are:
        the elements you want to style
    
    selectors can be:
        elements, 
        id's (indicated by a leading '#''), 
        classes (indicated by a leading '.'), 
        or combinations of the three

    property is:
        the detail about that element that you're styling

    value is:
        the way that you want it to be styled
 -->
    <style>
/* add a green styled p here */

    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- the style above will alter any p element in the body -->
